            As previously mentioned, the settlers utilize their owned media
            outlets to disseminate propaganda and falsehoods, distorting reality
            and truth to manipulate public perception. Additionally, some
            settlers are active on social media, spreading the same propaganda.
            Their messages seem uniformly scripted, contributing to their
            broader agenda of dominating the native population.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although some of us are actively speaking out online against the
            propaganda and falsehoods, our efforts seem to have limited impact
            compared to the extensive influence of the settlers. Many natives
            continue to accept and believe the settlers' narratives. Compounding
            this issue is our painful and complicated historyâ€”marked by
            enslavement, the loss of our identity, the imposition of foreign
            religions, and the portrayal of settlers as benevolent saviors. As a
            result, some natives are effectively working in the settlers'
            interest. To address this, we must launch a media campaign focused
            on countering the settlers' lies, propaganda, and distortions. Our
            goal is to educate and persuade the native population, shifting
            their support towards our movement and the cause of liberation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Central to the media campaign will be the large-scale creation and
            dissemination of media content. This content will reveal the truth,
            expose falsehoods and propaganda, provide education, and serve as a
            reference, effectively countering the settler media's influence. The
            media will be distributed across various social media platforms and
            incorporated into multiple searchable websites, making it accessible
            through popular search engines for easy discovery by users.
          </p>

          <p>
            Recently, the settlers launched a campaign promoting the false
            narrative of widespread white poverty in South Africa. Articles
            spreading this lie and propaganda appeared online, and many people
            believed it simply because it was available and unchallenged.
            Although some of us tried to refute these claims on social media,
            our efforts fell short of countering the extensive misinformation.
            Alarmingly, some natives were convinced by this falsehood,
            highlighting the severe risks of not having effective
            countermeasures against settler media and online propaganda.
          </p>

          <p>
            The settlers have repeated this tactic with various issues, such as
            claiming there are no jobs for white people in South Africa and
            alleging a white genocide in the country, among other falsehoods.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our media campaign will be a crucial tool in our struggle against
            the settlers and in mobilizing more supporters for our movement.
            Once the content is created and distributed, it will be essential
            for movement members to actively spread the truth using this
            content. For example, if propaganda about white poverty in South
            Africa appears on Twitter, thousands of us will respond by quoting
            the lies with accurate information and providing references.
            Similarly, if News24 publishes misleading claims about loans from
            MIF, we will counter with factual replies, presenting charts and
            evidence to expose the truth.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another aspect of the campaign will involve targeting and exposing
            specific social media users or pages that disseminate propaganda. A
            coordinated effort by thousands of users, all presenting the same
            truth, could reduce the presence of these sources or at least alert
            natives to their unreliability.
          </p>

          <p>
            Additionally, the media campaign will complement other initiatives.
            Given the volume of content that will be produced, there may be
            opportunities for temporary employment for students, allowing them
            to support themselves while gaining trust and confidence in the
            movement.
